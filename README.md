# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI - React Project

This project is an implementation of the famous tic-tac-toe game except this time you are being challenged to play against an Artificial Intelligence. The project was built using the React library to provide a dynamic user interface and the minmax algorithm as the logic behind the AI.

## Concepts Learned
During the development of this project, several important concepts were explored and applied, including:

1. **Componentization in React**: it was learned to divide the user interface into reusable components, making the code more maintainable and scalable.
2. **State Management**: React's useState hook was used to manage the game's state, such as the board and the current turn.
3. **Component Lifecycle**: it was understood how and when to use hooks like useEffect to control the lifecycle of React components.
4. **Minimax Algorithm**: the Minimax algorithm was implemented to create an AI that plays optimally, ensuring it always makes the best possible move.
5. **Styling with CSS**: styles were applied to make the game's interface visually attractive and user-friendly.
